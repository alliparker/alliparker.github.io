	<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>

	<h2>1. Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>I am inspired by <a href="http://www.manualcreative.com" target="_blank">Manual</a> and <a href="http://www.weplaydots.com" target="_blank">We Play Dots</a>.</p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>The use of negative space on the Manual site draws in the viewer to the focal point of the page, which is the image slider. The navigation menu at the top of the page is balanced symmetrically with the image. The interactive images on the "Work" page is a great example of a grid layout and creates a clean, sleek feel for the site. The images are above the fold in order to catch the viewer's eye. This site is a great example of responsive design.</p>
	<p>The use of bright colors and negative space on the WePlayDots site draws in the eye of the viewer. The visual hierarchy of the home page keeps the viewer's attention. The storytelling aspect of the content creates a great flow that keeps the viewer scrolling down the page. This is another great example of responsive design.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>The Manual site is a great example of minimalistic design. It has a clean, sleek interface with mostly black and gray text. The colorful images create a great contrast that keeps the viewer's attention. The use of geometric shapes creates balance. The We Play Dots site uses blocks of color to draw in the viewer's attention. The site tells a story, versus just showing examples of the company's work.</p>
	<p>The use of negative space on both sites is appealing. While the Manual site has more of a minimalistic theme than the We Play Dots site, the use of white space on the Dots home page creates a great contrast with the colors without looking too busy. I like the use of imagery as a focal point and the fact that the navigation menus create balance.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><figure><img src="homepage1.JPG" alt="homepage1">
		<figcaption>The title creates the focal point on the site, with the social media elements on the right and content area on the left balancing out the page.</figcaption></figure></li>
		<li><figure><img src="homepage2.JPG" alt="homepage2">
		<figcaption>The image scroller is the focal point of the page. The use of negative space creates a smooth, minimalistic design.</figcaption></figure></li>
		<li><img src="contentpage1.JPG" alt="contentpage1">
		<p>The title creates balance between the content on the left and the social media elements on the right. The navigation is directly below the title and uses padding between each element to create negative space.</p></li>
		<li><img src="contentpage2.JPG" alt="contentpage2">
		<p>Using a 12 column grid layout, the title and navigation of the site on the left would represent 3 columns and the content would represent 9 columns. The white space on the left balances out the content area on the right.</li>
		<li><img src="aboutpage1.jpg" alt="aboutpage1">
		<p>This layout draws the viewer in to continue scrolling below the fold. The image and text above the fold will encourage the viewer to keep reading. The title and white space surrounding the navigational menu at the top balance out the images below. I envision the images representing 3 columns each in a grid-based layout, with 1.5 columns of padding on each side.</p></li>
		<img src="archivepage1.JPG" alt="archivepage1">
		<li><p>Similar to the previous sketch, this would work well with a 12 column grid layout. The images are the focal point and draw the reader into the content.</p></li>	
		<img src="archivepage2.JPG" alt="archivepage2">
		<li><p>The three smaller images on the left balance out the social media elements (as represented by the blocks on the right). The title spans the entire page demonstrating the start of a visual hierarchy that quickly draws in the reader.</p></li>
	</ul>
