			<h1>my story</h1>
			<p>I’m a twenty-something young professional living in the Windy City, obsessed with pop culture, EDM, sweet tea, and all things tech. I'm a southern girl at heart – born and raised in North Carolina and a Tar Heel born and bred!<br><br>
			I spent the first five years post-college navigating the waters of our nation’s capital, working in the IT government sector as a communications specialist for a Senate-confirmed CIO. While living in DC, I also consulted for a large non-profit in the area, providing public relations services to several charitable organizations.<br><br>
			After four [longgg] years in government, I decided to take the plunge into private sector and move to a totally different city. Who knows, maybe the city of politics just wasn’t my cup of tea. Without thinking twice, I chose Chicago. Whenever I visited the city over the years I just felt different…maybe it was the view of the skyline flying into O’Hare or the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue.<br><br>
			I began applying for jobs during the summer of 2012 and voila! I was hired as a communications manager for a company that provides IT solutions to a global advertising conglomerate. My responsibilities include drafting technical communications and providing content strategy for our employees and clients in the US, Canada and Latin America.<br><br>
			My guilty pleasures include Avicii, dark nail polish, and Revenge on Netflix. So here I am – trying to make myself at home in my new city and rough out my first Chicago winter! Thanks for visiting and ya’ll come back now ya hear?<br><br>
