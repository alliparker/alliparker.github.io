	<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a strategic communications professional living in Chicago, IL. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I would like to be able to bring my writing and marketing copy to life through creative HTML email templates and responsive websites.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>

As I learn more about front-end, I would like to eventually be self-employed as a freelance writer and web designer with the goal of owning a consulting business at some point in my career. I would like to eventually work for myself because the thought of sitting in a cubicle and working a 9-5 corporate job for the rest of my life is not pleasant.

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Senior Recruiter,</strong> Jones Networking</li>
<li><em>Washington, D.C.,</em> 2007-2008</li>

<li><strong>Management and Program Analyst,</strong> Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Information and Technology</li>
<li><em>Washington, D.C.,</em> 2008-2012</li>

<li><strong>IT Communications Manager,</strong> Publicis Groupe</li>
<li><em>Chicago, IL,</em> 2012-present</li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p><strong>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,</strong> B.A. in Journalism/Public Relations, 2007</p>

<h2>Other</h2>
