		<h1>From Belgrade to Sarajevo: An Epic Road Trip</h1>
		<h2>August 11, 2014</h2>
		<p>Wow, I can’t believe it’s been almost two months since my last post. Summers in Chicago are short which means I have to make the most of it! Over the past few months, my weekends have been occupied with weddings, music fests, and visits from some of my favorite people. As summer comes to a close (I can’t even think about it!) my posts will become more frequent, I promise! Without further ado…<br><br>
		Belgrade was gritty yet enlightening, Mostar was quaint and memorable, but Sarajevo, the capital and largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina, captured my heart. Sarajevo was the second stop on our #YOGYPSY tour of the Balkans and probably my favorite (although it’s a tough call).<br><br>
		Before I get into the details of our stay in Sarajevo (which I’ll cover in a future post), I can’t go without mentioning our journey, as it is worthy of a dedicated blog post of its own. After two amazing days in Belgrade that involved climbing a fortress, catching the sunset at a rooftop bar and sharing rakija with a Serbian cover band, we boarded our bus for Bosnia at 9:30 AM sharp. It was here that we met our tour guide, Sasha, who stayed with us throughout our travels in and around the region.<br><br>

		An entire blog could be devoted to Sasha so I won’t get into too many details here. Let’s just say he is a former member of the Serbian Special Forces turned Lufthansa tour operator, a very interesting character to say the least. He has a cousin in Chicago (what are the odds), is scheming to move to Berlin, and believes every man should have three wives. Yep, I think that pretty much sums it up.<br><br>

		The distance from Belgrade to Sarajevo is about 124 miles, which you would think should take about 2 hours of driving time. As we began trekking up the remote mountains and stretches of narrow, two-lane roads, I realized this wouldn’t be the case. We could see Sasha’s patience being tested as he navigated us through the rolling hills, especially during our loud and oftentimes inappropriate conversations.
